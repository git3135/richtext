= Rich Text Editor Project =
Currently the only way to get rich text editing capabilities inside Eclipse RCP application is to use native browser widget. This is powerful but not very flexible solution. 

The goal of Rich Text Editor project is to create WYSIWYG Markup editor, which will be based on !StyledText widget and will allow basic HTML authoring, as well as will support most of features from jface text editing infrastructure.
