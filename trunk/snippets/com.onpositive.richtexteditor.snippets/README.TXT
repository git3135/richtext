This sample demonstrates creation of a view containing RichTextEditor.
This view supports undo/redo and spellchecking
Package com.onpositive.richtexteditor.snippets contains plugin activator and some classes needed to make Spellchecking work
(actually they are copies of Eclipse ones with little changes) 
Package com.onpositive.richtexteditor.snippets.views contains class SampleRichTextView, which represents a view itself.
